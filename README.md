# gemini-email-automation
Automates email responses to emails that match a certain criteria (that you set) using gemini and gmail apis.

To make this work you need to first create a project in the google cloud console and then enable and create the gemini/generative language api and gmail api.
Then you need to generate an api key for each (gemini api key, and gmail api key).
In your google project generate you oauth2 keys and download the json file and include this in the oauth2.keys.json file

More instructions are also available within the code.
